# Tinkering_Graphics_Team_6

### Started contract 5 (21/10/19)
Currently can create and save images for two different types of colour blindness from a file

Won't run create both at the same time as both files end up the same

Example of what images should look like [from here](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) and algorithms on how to generate them [from here](https://github.com/MaPePeR/jsColorblindSimulator/blob/master/colorblind.js)

### Contract 5 (22/10/19)
Will now run multiple colour blind images at a time
