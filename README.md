Run the python file in the same folder as [cat.jpg](https://wiki.startlap.hu/uploads/2016/01/adj-cimet-227.jpg). The programme may take a short while to run but you will be able to tell when it is completed as it would have output seven image files, the last one should be achromatopsia.jpg (black and white).
